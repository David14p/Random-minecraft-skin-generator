# Random-minecraft-skin-generator

**What is this?**

A python script that assigns every pixel in a 64x64 .png file a random color.
You can use this file as your Minecraft skin to have a 100% random Minecraft skin.

You don't have to install any libraries.

I know this isn't much but i made it for myself just for fun and decided to put it on here.
