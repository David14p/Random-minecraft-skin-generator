# Random-minecraft-skin-generator

A very simple python script that assigns every pixel in a 64x64 .png file a random color.
You can use this file as your Minecraft skin to have a 100% random and truly unique Minecraft skin.

You don't have to install any libraries to use this.

The file size might be to large to be used as a Minecraft skin. You can fix with a website like https://compresspng.com/
